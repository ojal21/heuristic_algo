# Heuristic Alogrithms
Number of moves required to correctly place the misplaced tiles in a 3x3 grid , numbered 1 through 9.

ALGORITHMS

- dfs : For running the Depth-first search algorithm
- ids : For running the Iterative deepening search algorithm
- astar1 : For running the A* algorithm with heuristic 1.
- astar2 : For running the A* algorithm with heuristic 2.

OUTPUT

Number of states,Number of moves, Output path
